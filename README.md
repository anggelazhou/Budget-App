## Budgeting Program

Project Inspiration
>My dad works in the computer science industry and has been talking about making an “invoice application” for years. He never got around to actually making it (as he is extremely busy with work), but the idea stuck with me. Since I first heard about this project, I’ve been thinking about how I can use the skills I’ve learnt in this course to make a program with a similar idea.

>As a fresh university student, I am still learning how to be independent. Budgeting my money is something I struggled greatly with in first year. I believe that by designing this program, I will not only get hands-on practice with the authentic software construction process, but I will also be creating something that is useful in my daily life.

App Info
> This program aims to help individuals better manage their money. It is suitable for teens and adults looking to track their expenses and plan their budget.
>
> Essentially, this program takes a budget and expenses, and provides a balance. Users are able to create categories (such as groceries, gas, etc.), and are given a general overview of the balances left for each one. When a category is selected, users are able to view previous expenses within the category, as well as will be given the option to add another expense.
